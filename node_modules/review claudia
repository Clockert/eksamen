I'm sorry, but I'm a bit overwhelmed by the amount of code, Charlotte. But kudos for all the effort you obviously have put into this.
Your commenting explain really well what the function does e.g. induce re-usable html components. From my point of view you did a really
god job on this project. The readme is almost on the same level as the reflective journal - maybe intentional? All the important information is
given. Your CSS is nicely build up - as the result shows.
